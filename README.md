# Option Pricing and Volatility Modeling

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and implementation of financial models for option pricing and volatility forecasting. The project encompasses the use of the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model to estimate volatility, various computational techniques to calculate option prices, and sophisticated methods for variance reduction in Monte Carlo simulations.

## Project Overview

The core components of this project include:

- **Volatility Modeling**: Utilize the GARCH(1,1) model to forecast and analyze the volatility of financial instruments.
- **Option Pricing**: Implement the Black-Scholes (BS) formula, Partial Differential Equation (PDE) methods, and Monte Carlo simulations to compute option prices.
- **Variance Reduction**: Apply variance reduction techniques such as antithetic variates and control variates within the Monte Carlo simulation framework to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the model.

## Features

- **GARCH(1,1) Implementation**: For modeling and visualizing the volatility of asset returns.
- **Option Pricing Methods**: Including closed-form solutions (BS formula), numerical solutions (PDE), and stochastic solutions (Monte Carlo).
- **Variance Reduction Techniques**: Utilization of antithetic variates and control variates to reduce the variance of Monte Carlo simulation results, leading to more stable and accurate option pricing.
